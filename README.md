# ⚙️ InstructionPipelineSimulator
Simulator for a time diagram of instruction pipeline operations. It allows you to simulate the flow of instructions through different stages in a pipeline and visualize the time required for each stage.

## Compilation and Execution of the Program

Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program folder `scr` is located.

Compile the source code by entering the following command:

`javac entities/Pipeline.java entities/PipelineState.java application/Main.java`

After compilation, execute the program by typing the following command:

`java application.Main`

## Program Usage

Using this program is straightforward and intuitive. Follow these steps to simulate an instruction pipeline:

1. Launch the program by compiling and running it, as explained in the "Compilation and Execution of the Program" section above.

2. The program will prompt you for the following information:
  - Enter the number of instructions.
  - Enter the amount of time.
  - Enter the number of pipeline stages.
  - For each pipeline stage, provide the following details:

3. Enter the name of the stage.
4. Enter the time required for that stage.

After entering all the necessary information, the program will generate and display a time diagram for the pipeline operations, you will see a visual representation of the instruction pipeline with stages labeled according to your input.

Enjoy using the simulator to explore instruction pipeline dynamics!
